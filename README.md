# plankit

**LLMs are open-ended by nature. Development needs deterministic outcomes. plankit bridges that gap — plans commit to an approach before code is written, templates suppress the patterns that cause drift, and tests protect what works.**

A plan-driven development toolkit for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) (Anthropic's AI coding agent). Designed for small teams and independent developers.

## What it does

`pk setup` installs the pieces that make plan-driven development work with Claude Code:

- **Installs rules and guidelines** — CLAUDE.md with critical rules, plus detailed `.claude/rules/` for model behavior, development standards, and git discipline
- **Adds Claude Code skills** — `/init`, `/changelog`, `/release`, `/preserve`
- **Preserves approved plans** — saved as timestamped documentation in `docs/plans/`, committed to git, and protected from accidental edits
- **Guards protected branches** — git mutations blocked via hooks, locally, before the damage happens

After setup, `/changelog` and `/release` become your daily driver — each previews, confirms, then runs.

## Install

Requires [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (for `go install`) and [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com).

```bash
go install github.com/markwharton/plankit/cmd/pk@latest
```

Or download a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/markwharton/plankit/releases) (no Go required).

After installing, run `pk setup` in your project to configure hooks and skills. See [Setup](#setup) below or [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for details.

## Setup

```bash
cd your-project
pk setup
```

This configures `.claude/settings.json` with hooks and installs skills. Restart Claude Code to apply.

### Modes

```bash
pk setup                       # Manual: use /preserve when ready
pk setup --preserve auto       # Auto: preserve plans on ExitPlanMode
```

Re-run setup anytime to switch.

| `pk version` | Print version and check for updates — [details](docs/pk-version.md) |

## Documentation

- [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) — install, setup, first run
- [Methodology](docs/methodology.md) — plan-driven development, guidelines, testing loop
- [Anti-Patterns](docs/anti-patterns.md) — what to watch for
- [Resources](docs/resources.md) — Claude Code best practices, git references

## Known Limitations

- **Ultraplan (preview)**: plankit hooks require `ExitPlanMode` and a local plan file in `~/.claude/plans/`. Ultraplan runs remotely and delivers plans inline — no local file is written and no `ExitPlanMode` fires, so preservation won't trigger. Use standard `/plan` mode for automatic preservation. ([Provide feedback](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues))

## Cross-platform

`pk` is a single Go binary with zero external dependencies. Builds for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Windows support relies on Git Bash, which is required by Claude Code.
